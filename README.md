# Notes to remember for myself

## Tree ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ²ðŸŒµðŸŒ´

- **Recursion** ---> **Stack** (remember the the russian dolls exp.)
    - **DFS** uses **Recursion** so ---> **Stack**
- Questions like levelOrderTraversal or SideView that is kinda LevelbyLevel, use the **val** and saving it in a list tho! like these: [LevelOrder](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/) + [SideView](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/) 

- Problems that are asking for counting the nodes that have specific charachtristic(e.g. good points, related to their values) always consider amount initiallay then compare *(e.g. res = 1, max(res, sth))*  like these questions; [GoodPoints](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-nodes-in-binary-tree/)
